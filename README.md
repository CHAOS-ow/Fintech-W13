# Project Title: VC Funding with Machine Learning

The project will create a model that predicts whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup. We will create a binary classification model using a deep neural network including preprocess data for a neural network model, using the model-fit-predict pattern to compile and evaluating a binary classification model.

## Technologies:

The project uses python 3.7 with the following packages:

* [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) - For providing data analysis and manipulation tool built on top of the Python programming language

* [sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) - Machine learning package in Python

* [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) - end-to-end open source platform for machine learning

## Installation Guide


Before running the application first install the following dependencies:

```python
import pandas as pd
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler,OneHotEncoder
```
